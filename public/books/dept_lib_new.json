    "Description": "Principles of Compiler Design, by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman, is a classic textbook on compilers for computer programming languages. Both of the authors won the 2020 Turing award for their work on compilers.It is often called the \"green dragon book\"[1] and its cover depicts a knight and a dragon in battle; the dragon is green, and labeled \"Complexity of Compiler Design\", while the knight wields a lance and a shield labeled \"LALR parser generator\" and \"Syntax Directed Translation\" respectively, and rides a horse labeled \"Data Flow Analysis\". The book may be called the \"green dragon book\" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi & Ullman's Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, which is the \"red dragon book\".",

    "ISBN": "80-203-2035-2",
    "Description": "For sophomore/junior-level courses in Programming Languages, Comparative Programming Languages, Language Design, and Organization of Programming Languages, in departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Comprehensive in approach, this text explores the major issues in both design and implementation of modern programming languages and provides a basic introduction to the underlying theoretical models on which these languages are based. It focuses on the underlying software and hardware architecture that guides language design, helping students understand why certain decisions are more rational than others in building a program. The emphasis throughout is on fundamental concepts―students learn important ideas, not minor language differences―but several languages are highlighted in sufficient detail to enable students to write programs that demonstrate the relationship between a source program and its execution behavior, without having to purchase separate language reference manuals.",
